    "An idea: I can pinpoint the rough locations of where a specific crop is grown by using the USDA data. From there, I could try using satellite imagery to teach a neural network model how each crop looks in each world are for it to detect where that specific area currently is, based on the most recent photos. It is very cumbersome but it is a solution.\n",
